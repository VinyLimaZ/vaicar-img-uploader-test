## A little explanation about my solution:

I made the most simple solution!
First I installed the ActiveStorage to handle the upload and the metadata;
Second I made a little service to generate and verify the slug, only to make it
decoupled and easy to reuse;
Third I included a front end library to style the app;
Last but not least I made the specs to verify the behavior of the
application;
